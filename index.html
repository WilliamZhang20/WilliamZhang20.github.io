    <h1>Hi! I'm William.</h1>
    <h2>I'm a computer engineering student at the University of Waterloo.</h2>
    <h3>Check out my <a href="./files/Resume.pdf">CV</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/williamzhang20/">LinkedIn</a>!</h3> <!--embedded link to resume pdf-->
    <h3>Find me on <a href="https://leetcode.com/WilliamZhang20/">LeetCode</a>, <a href="https://github.com/WilliamZhang20/">GitHub</a>, and <a href="https://dmoj.ca/user/Amateur360">DMOJ</a>.</h3><!--LeetCode + GitHub + DMOJ + Linkedin +-->

    <h3>About:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Starting my 2A term in September, with courses such as Electronic Circuits, Algorithms & Data Structures, Differential Equations, Numerical Methods, Chemistry, and Digital Computers</li>
        <br>
        <li>Recently worked as an embedded software developer intern at Ford in the summer of 2024.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Recent Projects:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li> Working on many AI projects, such as coding various ML algorithms from scratch to analyze MNIST images, an AI agent to play a game using reinforcement learning, and more!</li>
        <br>
        <li> Reading about computer networks, from resources such as <a href = "https://www.juniper.net/documentation/en_US/day-one-books/HDN.pdf">Hardware-Defined Networking</a>, by Brian Petersen, TCP/IP Illustrated, Volume 1 - The Protocols, and the Internet!</li>
        <br>
        <li> Figuring out how to use Wireshark... </li>
        <br>
        <li> Making <a href="./files/LeetCodeNotes.pdf">LeetCode Notes</a>, where I analyze the algorithms and methods used for the <b>150+ problems</b> I've solved so far. I also try to learn, understand, and implement a more optimized solution. <br> The problems I have solved involve concepts such as graph theory, dynamic programming, binary search trees, hash tables, and database queries.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Future projects:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li> Implementing an Operating System from scratch on an STM32, based on a lab syllabus from a 3rd year OS course at Uwaterloo. </li>
        <br>
        <li> Building and running reinforcement learning algorithms on OpenAI gym, which simulates a physical environment, such as Deep-Q Networks. </li>
        <br>
        <li> Constructing a Generative Adverserial Network (GAN) to implement neural style transfer. </li>
        <br>
        <li> Implementing a thread pool that can run recursive thread calls without deadlocking...</li>
    </ul>
